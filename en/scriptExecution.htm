<h1>Script execution precedence</h1>

<p><a href="scripts.htm">Script callback functions</a> are not executed in a random order: script location and type have an influence on  when (in relation to others) a script is executed or called: </p>

<p>Execution precedence is first and foremost based on location: a script object has always higher priority than its ancestory (e.g. parent, grand-parent, etc.) and thus will be called before. In case of two sibling script objects, precedence is given by the order they appear in the scene hierarchy, unless they have a different priority flag, in which case that flag decides the precedence. See the <a href="scriptPropertiesDialog.htm">script dialog</a> for details.</p>

<p>Execution precedence is next decided by the script type, from first to last executed: <a href="simulationScripts.htm">simulation script,</a> <a href="customizationScripts.htm">customization script</a>, <a href="addOns.htm">add-on</a>, and finally the <a href="sandboxScript.htm">sandbox</a>.</p>

<p class=imageLabel>[Example scene with script execution precedence]</p>

<p>A simple rule to remember is: the <em>more important</em> or <em>persistent</em> a script is, the later it will be called. There are exceptions to this, depending on the callback type: e.g. the <a href="contactCallbackScript.htm">contact</a>- and the <a href="dynCallbackFunctions.htm">dynamics callback</a> are executed in reverse order (within a given script type). Additionally, when the caller expects a return value, the call chain is interrupted as soon as the first return value is received.</p>
