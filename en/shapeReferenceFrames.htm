<h1>Shape reference frame and bounding box</h1>


<p>A <a href="shapes.htm">shape</a> has a reference frame and a bounding box, as does every <a href="objects.htm">object</a>. The shape reference frame however can be relocated, and its bounding box can be modified, without affecting the shape's other properties.</p>
<p>The reference frame of selected shapes can be moved in two different ways, via [Edit &gt; Shape reference frame]:</p>

<li><strong>relocate to world origin</strong>: the reference frame will move to the origin of the world </li>
<li><strong>relocate to mesh center</strong>: the reference frame will move to the center of the bounding box</li>

<p>The shape's inertia properties are unaffected when its reference frame moves, the inertia matrix and center of mass will however be expressed relative to the new reference frame.</p>
<p>The bounding box of selected shapes can be modified in two different ways, via [Edit &gt; Shape bounding box]:</p>

<li><strong>align with world</strong>: the bounding box will align with the reference frame of the world </li>
<li><strong>align with mesh</strong>: the bounding box will be chosen so as to minimize its volume</li>

<p>Note that the orientation of the bounding box does not need to be the same as the orientation of the reference frame.</p>
