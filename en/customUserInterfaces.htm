<h1>Custom User Interfaces</h1>


<p>V-REP offers two different custom user interfaces, where each one offers a specific behaviour, feature, or way to operate:</p>

<li><a href="customUIPlugin.htm"><strong>Qt-based custom UIs</strong></a>: this is the most recently developed custom UI type and  offers functionalities based on the Qt framework. Since it is wrapped in a V-REP plugin (<em>v_repExtCustomUI</em>), it is also relatively easy for users to extend its functionality. We highly recommend you to use this type of custom user interface.</li>
<li><a href="customUserInterface.htm"><strong>OpenGl-based custom UIs</strong></a>: this is the first developed custom UI type, and is based on OpenGl. It is relatively flexible, but might be unpractical and overly time-consuming when developing complex UIs. Additionally, it is unlikely that it will be further developed or improved in future. For that reason, it often makes more sense to use the <a href="customUIPlugin.htm">Qt-based custom UIs</a> instead.</li>
