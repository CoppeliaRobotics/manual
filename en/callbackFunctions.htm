<h1>Callback functions</h1>

<p>Callbacks or callback functions are script functions that are triggered by a specific event. They represent the only entrance into script code. They can be categorized into user callbacks, and system callbacks:</p>

<li>user callback functions are directly triggered by user code, or a plugin. This happens for instance when the user calls a script function in a different script via <a href="regularApi/simCallScriptFunction.htm">sim.callScriptFunction</a>, or when the user clicks a <a href="customUserInterfaces.htm">custom UI</a> button, which triggers a custom event. User callback functions can usually run in <a href="scripts.htm">any type of script</a>.</li>
<li>system callback functions on the other hand are triggered by CoppeliaSim when a certain event happens, for instance when a script is initialized, or before switching to another scene. System callback functions have fixed function names, such as <em>sysCall_init</em> or <em>sysCall_beforeInstanceSwitch</em>. Not all system callback functions are supported by all types of scripts, e.g. some can only run in an <a href="addOns.htm">add-on</a> (e.g. <em>sysCall_addOnScriptSuspend</em>).</li>
<p>While most system callback functions operate in a relatively straight-forward manner and are easy to understand (see further down for a complete list of system callback functions), some require a little bit more explanations:</p>
<li><a href="dynCallbackFunctions.htm">Dynamics callback functions</a> are called by the physics engine  before and after each dynamics simulation step</li>
<li>The <a href="contactCallbackFunction.htm">contact callback function</a> is called by the physics engine for each contact pair</li>
<li><a href="jointCallbackFunctions.htm">Joint callback functions</a> are called for custom joint control</li>
<li><a href="visionCallbackFunctions.htm">Vision callback functions</a> are called whenever an new image is acquires or applied</li>
<li><a href="triggerCallbackFunctions.htm">Trigger callback functions</a> are called when a certain trigger event is fired</li>
<li><a href="userConfigCallbackFunctions.htm">User config callback functions</a> are called when the user double-clicks a user parameter icon</li>

<br>
<p><a name="systemCallbacks"></a>Following is a list of all supported system callback functions. Most support returning {cmd='cleanup'} or {cmd='restart'} to end or restart the script. Refer to the comments in the code below for details about individual functions:</p>
