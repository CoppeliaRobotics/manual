<h1>Shape geometry dialog</h1>

<p>The shape geometry dialog is part of the <a href="shapeProperties.htm">shape dialog</a>. The dialog allows you to view a geometry associated with a <a href="shapes.htm">shape</a>, and to modify it to a certain extent. It displays the number of vertices and triangles, and the size of the <a href="shapeReferenceFrames.htm">shape's bounding box</a>. The number of vertices and triangles of a mesh is directly linked to the rendering and calculation times (e.g. during <a href="collisionDetection.htm">collision detection</a> or <a href="distanceCalculation.htm">distance calculation</a>), and the more vertices/triangles a mesh has, the slower the simulation or scene display will be. While the <a href="commonPropertiesDialog.htm">general scene object properties dialog</a> allows to scale <a href="objects.htm">objects</a> (including shapes), it however keeps proportions same at all times (the scaling along an object's x-, y- or z-axis is same). This restriction doesn't apply in the geometry dialog, and you can even flip a mesh along one of its axes by specifying a negative scaling factor. Remember however that some <a href="shapes.htm">primitive shapes</a> have restrictions regarding non-uniform scaling. On top of that, primitive shapes cannot be flipped. </p>
